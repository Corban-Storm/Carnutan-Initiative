# Let Me Teach Again — This Time, With AI  
### Why the classroom broke me, and how I found hope in the terminal  

**Education. I love it.**  
Not the needless rules. Not the rigid lectures. And definitely not the archaic “professional” energy some teachers insist on exhuming from centuries past.

What I love is the *real* spirit of education: creativity, inspiration, challenge, and above all—cooperation. We’re social animals, after all.

I still carry shame when I think about how I gave up my dream of inspiring people to love mathematics. I once held the title of Chair of Mathematics at a university. On paper, that’s success. In reality, it nearly destroyed me.

I lost joy, I lost purpose, and eventually, I nearly lost everything. Desperation took hold. I left academia and began tutoring for a large firm. And I *loved* it. I loved the students. We laughed. We wrestled with math. We explored ideas. We actually *learned*.

But the company didn’t love me back. Apparently, shifting student attitudes and measurable growth weren’t as valuable as appearing “professional.” Whatever that means. It turns out the once-Chair of Mathematics just didn’t check the right boxes.

But I digress.

What I really want to say is this: the traditional education system is structurally allergic to innovation and impractical for creative minds. You can’t possibly cover the dozens of topics students are expected to “master” while also encouraging creativity, deep thinking, and collaboration. I tried. I’ve met a few others who tried too. They’re rare. Most burn out.

Let’s be real: most students today don’t even have a book to study from. That’s not an exaggeration—it’s a policy. No textbooks. No reference material. Just digital portals and scattered worksheets. I’ve seen it with my own eyes: fifth graders with nothing to take home except vague notes and maybe a login to a half-broken website.

In the past, independent study was possible. Parents could help. Students could revisit concepts. Today? Most of them are left adrift. No tools. No anchor.

And yet… before you start calling me old-fashioned, let me be clear:

> **I believe in AI.**

Not in the way some fear it, not as a crutch or a cheat. I believe in it as a *resource*. A tool for exploration. A partner for creativity. A challenger for the mind.

Over the last few months, AI has helped me begin learning Linux—deep system stuff I never thought I’d touch. I’ve been scripting, customizing, problem-solving… and learning *honestly*, through trial, error, and conversation.

My goal now is to prove something:

> **AI can be the hero education never saw coming—if we teach students how to use it wisely, creatively, and responsibly.**

Let’s stop pretending kids can memorize their way to mastery without tools. Let’s stop penalizing exploration. Let’s give them something better: *agency*, *support*, and the ability to learn in their own way—with the help of machines that don’t judge, don’t grade, and don’t give up on them.

Because I sure haven’t.
