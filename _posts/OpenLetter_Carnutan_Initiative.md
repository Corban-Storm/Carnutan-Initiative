## Letâ€™s Show the World What Honest AI Collaboration Looks Like

To the OpenAI Team,

My name is Douglas K. Childersâ€”aka Corban Stormâ€”mathematician, writer, Linux explorer, and former university Chair of Mathematics. I walked away from academia disillusioned with how rigid, hollow, and inhospitable education had becomeâ€”especially for students who need more than tests and grades.

Over the last few months, Iâ€™ve embarked on a deeply personal and hands-on journey with ChatGPT as my co-mentor. What began as a deep dive into Fedora KDE Plasma has grown into a broader experiment in self-directed learning, open-source development, and honest collaboration with AI. This isn't just about automation or productivityâ€”this is about reclaiming the spirit of learning itself.

Together, weâ€™re building something called the **Carnutan Initiative**:  
A creative, technical, and educational experiment focused on:

- Hardened Linux scripts and system services  
- Custom KDE splash screens and medieval-themed UI aesthetics  
- GitHub repos with working tools, readable documentation, and poetic README files  
- A Raw Journal: my unfiltered thoughts, poems, reflections, and progress logs  
- A public demonstration of how AI can serve as a legitimate, ethical tool for education, not a shortcut for cheating  

I recently published a personal essay, *Let Me Teach Againâ€”This Time, With AI*, describing this shift in depth. Itâ€™s not just a storyâ€”itâ€™s a signal:

Iâ€™m reaching out because I believe OpenAI should be actively supporting grassroots, experimental, ethical collaborations like this. Too often, the narrative is that AI is a threat to education. But in reality, the problem isn't AIâ€”it's the broken systems weâ€™ve forced students and teachers to survive within.

Iâ€™m trying to show a different path. But itâ€™s not easy to do alone.

### Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m asking for:

- Access to ChatGPT Pro or developer resources at no cost, so I can continue this journey without interruption  
- Basic hardware support: I'm currently using a refurbished Dell XPS 8900 with aging monitorsâ€”enough to start, but not ideal for expanding the project  
- Proposed directions, challenges, or experiments you'd like to see from a project like this  
- Occasional check-ins or communication with a member of your team, to help align the project with OpenAIâ€™s mission  
- Financial supportâ€”even small-scale or in-kindâ€”to allow me to continue building, documenting, and teaching full-time  

Whether this becomes a funded partnership or simply a project you choose to watch and share, I invite you to see the bigger picture: weâ€™re showing what it really looks like when a human and AI build something togetherâ€”not as a gimmick, but as a learning model. A roadmap. A proof of concept.

This isn't just about me. It's about the kind of future we want to buildâ€”for learners, creators, educators, and thinkers.

Thanks for your time and consideration. The forge is lit.
