## üìú Original Poem

> Moonbeams dance an awkward yellow light.  
> Shooting stars trace lines of white.  
> Dreamy visions of what just might  
> Fill the future  
>  
> Reading mirrors like dancing stars.  
> And horror is written on the window  
> With red lipstick and the hint of night  
> Stolen by a villain‚Äôs hand,  
> Plucked from this land.  
>  
> Windy blasts thrill the night.  
> Cold shadows cast to fill the light  
> That once held hope, blue turns white  
> The army of Armageddon.

## üîç Academic Analysis

### üîß Form & Structure

- The poem is divided into **three stanzas** of varied length and line count.
- The **first and third stanzas use rhyme** (`light/white/might`) suggesting a loose AABA or ABCB structure.
- Lines tend to be compact, with sharp line breaks that isolate imagery.
- No formal meter, but there‚Äôs a rhythm that flows conversationally.

### üé≠ Tone & Mood

- Shifts between **romantic and apocalyptic**: the first stanza evokes dreamy possibility; by the last, we‚Äôre in ‚Äúthe army of Armageddon.‚Äù
- There‚Äôs a sense of **foreboding** disguised in beauty, and beauty tainted by threat.
- The poem plays on this tension between intimacy and destruction.

### üé® Imagery & Symbolism

- The imagery is cosmic: **moonbeams, stars, mirrors**, but then turns domestic and violent: **lipstick, villain‚Äôs hand, cold shadows**.
- The ‚Äúred lipstick‚Äù on the window evokes **violated beauty** or a broken promise‚Äîpossibly alluding to death, violence, or lost love.
- The final line invokes **apocalypse**‚Äî‚Äúthe army of Armageddon‚Äù‚Äîsuggesting war, personal or universal.

### üó£Ô∏è Diction & Syntax

- Accessible vocabulary mixed with metaphorical density.
- Syntax is fairly direct; most lines stand alone clearly.
- A few **enjambed moments** invite re-reading to unpack layered meaning (e.g., ‚ÄúCold shadows cast to fill the light / That once held hope‚Äù).

## üìö Comparative Reading

**Reference Poem:** *The Second Coming* by W.B. Yeats

Yeats‚Äô work shares the sense of dread and cosmic foreboding:
> ‚ÄúThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...‚Äù

**Comparison Points:**
- Both poems evolve from **subtle disturbance to apocalyptic vision**.
- Yeats‚Äô chaos is social and metaphysical; yours is more intimate and emotional.
- You echo the same shift from prophecy to vision, though more in **personal metaphor** than political imagery.

## üß† Educational Reflection

- You are intuitively using **symbolic escalation**, moving from light and beauty into horror and darkness.
- Your control over **tone-shift** is strong; it feels seamless but deliberate.
- What to improve: explore **meter** or pattern more consciously; consider whether rhyme supports or distracts from your voice.
- Experiment with **volta-style turns** (a hard shift mid-poem), to sharpen dramatic impact.
