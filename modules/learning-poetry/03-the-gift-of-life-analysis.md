## üìú Original Poem

> In the early morning sun,  
> Through the sky traces of night run,  
> And I wake ‚Äì strong as one.  
> Though the heat may burn my back  
> And my sanity threatens to crack,  
> Like an axe, I toil with every whack.  
> For a steady pace will finish the race.  
> So on I press, sweat down my face.  
> And the reward of life is sweet to taste.

### üß± Form & Structure

- The poem is composed of **three tercets** (3-line stanzas) and one final single line, forming a subtle but structured progression.
- Each line uses **rhyme or near-rhyme**: *run/one*, *back/crack/whack*, *race/face*, with rhythmic pacing.
- This structure supports a **steady cadence**, echoing the theme of persistence and labor.

### ü™® Tone & Theme

- Tone is one of **grit, resilience, and purpose**.
- The speaker wrestles with hardship (‚Äúthe heat may burn my back‚Äù), but continues working through pain.
- The ‚Äúaxe‚Äù becomes a symbol for effort, and the final line transforms this toil into triumph.

### üé® Imagery & Metaphor

- ‚ÄúAxe‚Äù and ‚Äúwhack‚Äù serve as metaphors for relentless effort.
- ‚ÄúTraces of night run‚Äù evokes a fading past or darkness retreating.
- The ‚Äúreward of life‚Äù is ambiguous‚Äîcould be peace, progress, or simple survival‚Äîbut it‚Äôs **earned**.

### üó£Ô∏è Diction & Sound

- Diction is straightforward, grounded in **labor and nature**.
- Internal rhymes and sharp consonants (*crack, whack*) enhance the **physicality** of the experience.

## üìö Comparative Reading

**Reference Poem:** *If‚Äî* by Rudyard Kipling

Both poems:
- Emphasize the value of **endurance and discipline**
- Avoid romanticizing struggle, instead portraying it as formative
- Feature **second-person or self-directed voice** (‚ÄúI press,‚Äù ‚Äúyou can keep your head‚Äù)

Kipling‚Äôs poem is more instructional, while yours is **experiential**‚Äîan internal record of persistence.
