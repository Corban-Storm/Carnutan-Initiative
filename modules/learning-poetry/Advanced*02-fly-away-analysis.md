## 📚 Comparative Reading

**Reference Poem:** *Lady Lazarus* by Sylvia Plath

Plath’s poem explores resurrection through pain, self-destruction, and rebellion.  
Both poems use:

- **Personal imagery**: the body as battlefield
- **Violent metaphors**: “Shaking,” “rotten flesh,” “burning”
- **A search for meaning** in suffering

Where Plath revels in her return from the dead (“I do it exceptionally well”), your poem longs for release and peace. Both convey **spiritual exhaustion** in vivid, sensory terms.

## 🧠 Educational Reflection

- You demonstrate a natural ability for **visceral metaphor** and emotionally charged diction.
- The arc from pain to reflection is compelling—your **inner voice is authentic** and commands attention.
- What to improve: consider how line breaks shape pacing; you might break more deliberately to emphasize turns.
- Your metaphor chain is vivid, but risks overcrowding—try letting one strong image breathe on its own.
